# Barcodely

## Send barcode events to Odoo

This allows us to test barcode functionality without the need of an barcode scanner. 

There are other options out there, albeit, they are: Heavy, require a mobile app, subscription based, etc. 

### What Works

* Send barcode events
* Save barcodes to listbox

### What's missing

* Persistent barcodes in listbox
* User configuration (eg. Window title names, etc)
